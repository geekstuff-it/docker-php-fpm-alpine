# php-fpm-alpine


The intention here is to instantly be able to:
- spawn a new php project,
- have an easy and full dev environment with xdebug
- a proper php-fpm docker image build that will turn on all optimisations like infinite opcache or preloading
- a separate nginx build that only has public/ content
